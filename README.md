# ☎️ Mystery Call Box

An interactive project that merges **modern technology** with a **vintage twist**.  
When the user places their phone inside the box, it **locks automatically** using a secret code.  
Beside the box is a **retro 1970s telephone** that rings after the lock is activated.  
When the user answers, they receive a **mysterious voice message** containing clues and a series of **mini-games** they must complete to retrieve the unlock code.  

The project’s goal is to create a unique, playful, and suspenseful **visitor experience** by combining electronics, interaction, and storytelling.
